# Recommender-System
This project is part of the Harvardx Data Science capstone course. The goal of the project is to build a recommender system that can predict movie ratings by different users for the Movielens dataset.  

On the first approach, an attempt to optimize the model described in the book "Introduction to Data Science" by Rafael A. Irizarry will be made. The second approach involves Matrix factorization using the Recosystem package.

This project was made using R Studio version 1.2.5019. R version 3.6.1.

This repo contains 3 files. A PDF, an Rmarkdown and an R file containing all the code used in building this project.
